## About The Project

<img src ="screenshots/index.png" width = "400" align = "right" >

As for now, India has the highest growth rate of internet users, and has the internet user base of 627 million as of December 2019, about 50% of the total population. Still the penetration of E-commerce is pretty low if compared to countries like United States and France, but is growing, adding over 6 million new entrants every month.

With the recession being a thing of past, the furniture and homeware industry is a good indicator of how the housing market largely recovered its losses. However, furniture and home d√©cor producers face new challenges posed by the digital transformation as an increasing number of consumers turn to the internet in search of their new candelabra. Can home and kitchen brands survive by relying solely on traditional distribution channels?

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
